# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project analyzing passenger survival on the Titanic using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

---

## 📌 Objective

* Explore survival patterns in the dataset
* Identify key predictive features
* Build and evaluate machine learning models

---

## 📊 Dataset

* 891 passengers
* Survival Rate: **38.38%**
* Key features: Sex, Pclass, Age, Fare, Embarked, Family info

---

## 🔍 Key EDA Insights

* **Gender** is the strongest predictor (female survival significantly higher).
* **Passenger class** strongly affects survival.
* **Fare** positively correlates with survival.
* Age and family features show weaker linear impact.
